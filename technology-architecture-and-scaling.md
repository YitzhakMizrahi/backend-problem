# Languages/Tools

For this challenge, I chose to use **Node.js** as the programming language for the backend. Node.js is a popular and mature platform for building scalable server-side applications and is well-suited for building **RESTful APIs**. Node.js is also known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it highly performant and efficient, particularly for handling large numbers of concurrent requests.

In terms of selecting specific libraries for this project, I chose to use **Express** as the web application framework due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. Express is a widely-used framework that provides a lightweight and unopinionated approach to building web applications, making it easy to build RESTful APIs and handle middleware.

I also used **Mongoose** as the ODM (Object Document Mapper) library for MongoDB, which provides a straightforward and intuitive way to interact with MongoDB from Node.js applications. Mongoose simplifies the process of defining and validating data models, as well as providing features such as schema validation, query building, and hooks.

For handling validation of incoming requests, I chose to use **Joi**, a powerful and flexible validation library for Node.js. Joi is well-documented, easy to use, and can handle complex validation rules and nested objects.

Lastly, I used **Dotenv** to manage environment variables, allowing me to easily switch between different environments (such as development, staging, and production) without having to modify the code. Dotenv is a popular library for managing environment variables in Node.js applications and provides a simple and lightweight way to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

Overall, I selected these specific libraries based on their ease of use, popularity, and ability to handle the specific requirements of this backend challenge.

# Cloud Architecture

To scale this backend system to handle millions of requests per day, I would follow a cloud-based microservices architecture.

The system would be built using Docker containers and orchestrated using Kubernetes. This would allow for the deployment of the system to be automated, and Kubernetes can handle scaling the services up or down based on demand.

The microservices would be designed to handle specific functions, such as configuration, data storage, and data processing, and would communicate with each other using RESTful APIs.

For data storage, I would use a cloud-based NoSQL database, such as MongoDB or DynamoDB, to allow for horizontal scaling and high availability.

I would also incorporate caching solutions like Redis to improve the performance of frequently accessed data.

In addition, I would utilize a content delivery network (CDN) to improve the speed of serving static assets to clients around the world.

Here is a diagram of the proposed architecture:

In this architecture, the load balancer would distribute incoming requests to multiple instances of the API gateway. The API gateway would then direct requests to the appropriate microservice, which would communicate with the cloud-based data storage and caching solutions.

The client application would interact with the API gateway to retrieve and display data.

Overall, this cloud-based microservices architecture would provide a scalable and highly available solution to handle millions of requests per day.
